# Locals
A Social Media app seeking to bridge the knowledge gap between travelers and local residents.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Running the project

To run the project, first, clone the repository to your local machine. Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the folder.
When in the folder, use the command 'npm start' (make sure that npm is installed on your machine).

This should launch the application in the browser window, prompting you to log in. For this, you can use our test user account:

Username: TestUser
Password: Locals

After logging in, you will be redirected to the homepage, and you can freely explore our platform.

Enjoy!
